# Reconstruct one 3D mesh from multiple photographs

`build-photo-model` connects the existing camera-registration, dense-mesh and
Blender GLB-export workers into one command. This is **photogrammetry**, not a
procedural reconstruction or Gaussian splat. It can use a private folder of
8–256 overlapping photographs, including a 30-photo monument reference set.

## Mac (Apple Silicon)

Install Python with `pip install -e '.[photogrammetry,qa]'` and Blender separately.
Build/install the **OpenMVS command-line utilities**, and ensure these names
resolve on your `PATH`: `InterfaceCOLMAP`, `DensifyPointCloud`,
`ReconstructMesh`, `RefineMesh`, `TextureMesh`. Install `pycolmap` in the Python
environment running `kumiki-blender`. `blender` must also be on your `PATH`
or supplied with `--blender /full/path/to/blender`.

```bash
kumiki-blender plan-photo-model \
  --photos /path/to/sphinx-photos --asset-id great-sphinx \
  --output .review/great-sphinx/photo-r01

# Only start after the plan reports ready-to-reconstruct:
kumiki-blender build-photo-model \
  --photos /path/to/sphinx-photos --asset-id great-sphinx \
  --output .review/great-sphinx/photo-r01
```

For a curated dossier with source URLs, viewpoints and optional object masks,
replace `--photos DIR --asset-id NAME` with `--manifest PATH`. Run `plan` and
`build` with the **same unused output directory**: `plan` never creates it.
Each `build` run consumes that destination; for retries use a new revision,
such as `photo-r02`, to preserve diagnostic evidence.

### Reuse cameras already registered by the Sphinx splat pipeline

If a previous `mac_splat_test.sh run` successfully registered the photographs,
**do not rerun COLMAP**. Point `--reconstruction` at its existing
`sparse-reconstruction/` directory, not at the `splat-retry-*` output:

```bash
SOURCE=.review/mac-splat-smoke/splat-20261103T063944Z-55327/sparse-reconstruction
OUTPUT=.review/great-sphinx/mesh-from-registered-01
kumiki-blender plan-photo-model --reconstruction "$SOURCE" --output "$OUTPUT"

# Only when the plan reports ready-to-reconstruct, and OUTPUT does not exist:
kumiki-blender build-photo-model --reconstruction "$SOURCE" --output "$OUTPUT"
```

This skips PyCOLMAP and feature matching entirely, requires only the OpenMVS
and Blender runtime dependencies on macOS, and verifies the existing registered
images, camera files and provenance before meshing. The original source stays
untouched. The output records its absolute source path and file hashes; keep
that private source revision available if you need to reproduce the mesh.

Only after checking **every** mask against the full statue silhouette, you can
optionally add `--rectified-masks /path/to/reviewed-mask-revision/masks` to both
commands. The masks must match all registered **undistorted** images in name,
resolution and binary values. Merely passing mask validation does **not**
establish that the head, body, paws and tail were retained correctly. Do not
use the failed general-purpose `rembg` Sphinx masks.

For a CUDA-enabled computer, select `--engine colmap --backend colmap`, after
installing COLMAP with GPU support. This path does not presently create a
photographic texture atlas: the GLB receives the dense mesh's material.
On Mac, the default `--engine pycolmap --backend openmvs` supports CPU sparse
registration and CPU dense meshing, with OpenMVS texture mapping enabled.
To skip texture transfer, pass `--no-texture`.

## What gets created

On success, the private output folder contains:

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `model.glb` | Blender-exported mesh, re-audited as glTF 2.0 with geometry |
| `review/private-*.blend` | Editable Blender file with imported reconstructed geometry |
| `review/renders/` | Axis QA renders and up to eight real registered-camera views (unless `--no-renders`) |
| `sparse/` | New camera registration when building from photos; when reusing cameras, the unchanged source remains in its original revision |
| `dense/` | Reconstructed geometry, textures when available, meshing reports |
| `photo-model-report.json` | Stage status, actual registered counts, final GLB SHA-256, blockers |

The GLB is a **private candidate, not an approved likeness**. A passing GLB
format audit does not measure historical facial similarity, correct scale,
surface roughness, right-of-publicity, or photo/texture redistribution rights.
Keep generated meshes and photos outside Git and review source licenses before
publishing texture-derived assets.

## When 30 photos still cannot reconstruct a 3D mesh

Eight distinct image files do **not** mean eight overlapping cameras.
Internet photos may be compressed, cropped, shot from nearly identical angles,
or have tourists/scaffolding hiding key features. A dataset dominated by front
and left views may not recover the Sphinx's right cheek or back at all.

1. Check `photo-model-report.json`: `failed_stage` names the failing stage.
2. For camera failures, read `sparse/reconstruction-report.json` and logs.
   If fewer than eight images register, use more photos **with adjacent,
   overlapping viewpoints**, not just more unrelated images.
3. For missing or patchy mesh surfaces, inspect `dense/dense-report.json` and
   try reviewed masks or more overlapping source views. Existing advanced
   `prepare-dense-masks` and `build-dense-photos` commands remain available.
4. For Blender export failures, inspect `logs/blender-export.log` and
   `review/blender-review-report.json`; no `model.glb` is promoted on failure.
5. Compare the registered-camera renders in `review/renders/` with their
   corresponding undistorted photographs before claiming the statue is faithful.

The pipeline deliberately **never substitutes an illustrative Sphinx** for
unrecovered geometry. A measured scan/survey or artist sculpting can still be
needed when photographs do not contain reconstructible details.
